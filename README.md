Run the exe in the StandoffComputer folder if you are just interested in the game. You need the other file in that folder to actually run the thing.
## Game Summary
Green George has been chasing after the treasure for a long time.

Pink Phil is seeking vengeance for his brother's death.

Orange Oscar could use the treasure to save the orphanage.

For Silver Sam it is just another Tuesday.

Needless to say, only one man will walk out of here alive. 


## Rundown
You start the game with your gun empty facing off against three other players/ai.

This game only supports controllers. First controller plugged in is Green George, second is Pink Phil, third is Orange Oscar, fourth is Silver Sam. If there are less than four controllers an AI will take over the empty spots.
